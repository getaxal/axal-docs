The Axal points program begins on June 10, 2025. It is designed to incentivize user engagement and loyalty for Axal and within the Axal ecosystem.

## Points System Overview

Users earn points based on the following actions:

| Action                                 | Points Earned | Scaling Metric                                      |
|----------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Deposit Funds                          | 1             | 1 point for every $1 deposited                      |
| No Withdrawals (30-day periods)        | 50            | N/A                                                 |
| Refer a New User                       | 100           | Per user                                            |
| Referred User who Deposits $1,000+     | 200           | Per user                                            |
| Withdraw Funds                         | -1            | 1 point for every $1 withdrawn                      |
| Daily drop                             | 1-3           | 1 conservative; 2 balanced; 3 aggressive (weighted) |

- The daily drop is a weighted average depending on your allocation between conservative, balanced, and aggressive strategies.

## USDC Airdrops for Points Holders

Axal will begin by recycling 5% of all revenue generated into USDC airdrops, distributed on a pro-rata basis to points holders. This means the more points you have, the larger your share of the airdrop.

*Legal Disclaimer: Axal reserves the right to change this metric up or down at any point in time.*

## Status Tiers

There are five Status Tiers in Axal. Your tier acts as a points multiplier:

| Tier    | Points Scale | How to Achieve                |
|---------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| Gold    | 3x           | Deposit more than $10,000     |
| Platinum| 2.5x         | Deposit more than $5,000      |
| Silver  | 2x           | Deposit more than $1,000      |
| Bronze  | 1.5x         | Deposit more than $100        |
| Wood    | 1x           | Deposit less than $100        |

*Your points are scaled by 1-3x depending on your tier.*

## Quests

There will be ongoing Quests in Axal, such as:

| Quest                                 | Points  |
|----------------------------------------|---------|
| Deposit $1,000 or more                 | 1,500   |
| Put 25% or more in Aggressive Strat    | 1,000   |

Axal reserves the right to adjust point distributions and potential future airdrop distributions at its discretion. The program includes multipliers to encourage sustained participation within the ecosystem.
