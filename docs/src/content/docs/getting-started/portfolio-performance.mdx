## Portfolio Dashboard
Your dashboard provides real-time insights into your overall performance and positions. The top section contains a snapshot card with key, at‑a‑glance metrics.

### Snapshot Card
- **Last 7D APY**: The trailing 7‑day annualized yield, updated daily. This smooths out day‑to‑day noise while reflecting recent performance.
- **Uninvested Cash**: Total idle balance not currently allocated to strategies. You can click “Allocate” to put this to work or keep some buffer for upcoming withdrawals.
- **Net Deposits / Withdrawals**: Your cumulative cash flow in and out of the account.
- **YTD Return**: Year‑to‑date performance net of fees.

### Graphs & Visualizations
- **Performance Over Time**: Line chart of account value and benchmark comparisons.
- **APY Trend**: Rolling 7‑day APY series to track consistency and momentum.
- **Allocation by Strategy**: Donut or stacked chart showing how capital is distributed.

### Strategy Page Deep‑Dive
From the dashboard, open the Strategy page to see:
- Current strategies in use and target/actual allocations.
- Protocol‑level positions (e.g., Morpho, Euler, Maple) and network distribution.
- Risk flags and notes (e.g., liquidity, utilization, oracle health).

## Key Metrics
- **Total Value**: Current portfolio worth
- **APY**: Annual percentage yield
- **Daily Change**: 24‑hour performance
- **Monthly Change**: 30‑day performance
- **Total Earnings**: Cumulative returns

## Good Practices for Monitoring Performance
- **Check Weekly**: Review the snapshot card each week and compare the Last 7D APY to prior periods.
- **Watch Uninvested Cash**: Keep a small buffer for upcoming withdrawals, but minimize idle amounts to avoid cash drag.
- **Validate Allocations**: Ensure your allocation by strategy matches your risk tolerance and investment horizon.
- **Drill Into Strategies**: Use the Strategy page to confirm protocol health and understand sources of yield.
- **Compare to Benchmarks**: Track your performance against simple baselines (e.g., stablecoin lending APY) to contextualize results.
- **Review Events**: Check the activity log for deposits, withdrawals, and rebalances that impact returns.
