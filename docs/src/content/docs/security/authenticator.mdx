### Two-Factor Authentication for Withdrawals

To ensure maximum security when making withdrawals, Axal requires two-factor authentication (2FA) using Google Authenticator. This additional security layer protects against unauthorized access to your private keys and seed phrases.

#### Why Google Authenticator is Required

Making withdrawals grants complete access to your funds, making it one of the most sensitive operations on the platform. Google Authenticator provides:

- **Time-based Security:** Codes expire every 30 seconds, preventing replay attacks
- **Offline Protection:** Works without internet connection, protecting against phishing
- **Device-bound Security:** Codes are generated locally on your device, not transmitted over networks
- **Industry Standard:** Widely adopted security practice used by major financial institutions

#### Installing Google Authenticator

**For iOS devices:**
1. Open the App Store on your iPhone or iPad
2. Search for "Google Authenticator"
3. Tap "Get" to download the official Google Authenticator app
4. Once installed, open the app and follow the setup prompts

**For Android devices:**
1. Open Google Play Store on your Android device
2. Search for "Google Authenticator"
3. Tap "Install" to download the official Google Authenticator app
4. Launch the app after installation completes

#### Setting Up 2FA for Wallet Export

1. **Access Security Settings:**
   - Navigate to your account settings in the Axal dashboard
   - Select "Security" from the menu options
   - Find the "Two-Factor Authentication" section

2. **Initialize 2FA Setup:**

   - You'll see a QR code displayed on your screen

3. **Scan the QR Code:**

   - Tap the "+" button or "Add Account"
   - Select "Scan QR Code" 
   - Point your camera at the QR code displayed on your computer screen
   - The app will automatically detect and add your Axal account

4. **Verify Setup:**
   - Google Authenticator will generate a 6-digit code for Axal
   - Enter this code in the verification field on the Axal website
   - Click "Verify" to complete the setup

5. **Save Backup Codes:**
   - After successful verification, you'll receive backup recovery codes
   - Store these codes securely offline (not on your computer or cloud storage)
   - These codes can be used if you lose access to your authenticator device

#### Using 2FA for Withdrawals

When you want to make a withdrawal:

1. Navigate to "Withdrawal" in your account settings
2. Enter your account password when prompted
3. Open Google Authenticator on your mobile device
4. Find your Axal account and note the current 6-digit code
5. Enter the code in the 2FA verification field
6. Complete the withdrawal process to receive your private key or seed phrase

**Important Security Notes:**
- Never share your authenticator codes with anyone
- Keep your mobile device secure and updated
- Store backup codes in a secure, offline location
- If you lose your device, use backup codes to regain access and re-setup 2FA immediately
