An introduction to EIP 7702 and how it brings smart account capabilities to a classic wallet when needed.

## What is EIP 7702

EIP 7702 allows a standard key controlled account to adopt smart account behavior on demand. Your account behaves like a normal wallet by default. When you need advanced features the wallet adds a short lived authorization that lets your account execute code for that action. After the action completes your account returns to normal.

## Why this matters

People want the ease of a familiar wallet and the safety and flexibility of code based controls. EIP 7702 gives you both without making you deploy a dedicated contract for your account or carry ongoing overhead.

## How it works at a glance

1. Normal state: your account acts like any other standard wallet.
2. Upgrade step: your wallet sends a transaction that includes an authorization referencing code to run.
3. Enhanced state: your account can validate and execute advanced logic for that action.
4. Back to normal: once done, the account returns to standard behavior.

## Practical benefits

* No separate contract deployment for your account
* Works with existing wallets and applications
* Turn on advanced features only when you need them
* Avoid always on overhead and save gas

## Examples of advanced features

* Batch several operations into one transaction
* Add extra approval rules like multiple approvals or time locks
* Use a paymaster to sponsor gas or pay in a token
