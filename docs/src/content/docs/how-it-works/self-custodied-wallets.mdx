An introduction to how Axal implements self custody so you remain in control of your assets at all times.

## What is a self custody wallet

A self custody wallet is software that manages your cryptographic keys on your device. These keys prove you own your assets and allow you to authorize actions on chain. The private key must remain secret. The public key is derived from the private key and your address is a short form identifier you share with others. When you send a transaction you create a digital signature using your private key that proves you approved that action.

### Key concepts

* Private key is your proof of ownership and must stay secret
* Public key is derived from the private key
* Address is a short identifier derived from the public key
* Wallet is the application that manages keys and helps you interact with the chain

## Account types in simple terms

### Externally owned accounts

Self-custody means you maintain full control over your private keys and assets. These are familiar accounts that are controlled directly by a private key. They can initiate transactions and send ETH, but they do not execute code on their own. Gas is paid in ETH. If the key is lost there is no recovery. Each transaction performs a single operation.

### Smart accounts

These are accounts that are controlled by code. They can enforce rules for how transactions are approved, require multiple approvals, support social recovery, allow gas to be paid in tokens, batch multiple operations in a single transaction, and enforce time delays or spending limits.

## Bringing it together smoothly

In practice most people want the simplicity of a key controlled account with the safety and flexibility of code based controls. Axal helps you keep ownership while adding practical protections and convenience, so everyday actions feel simple and important actions can be gated with extra checks.

## How Axal applies self custody

* Your wallet is non custodial through Privy smart wallets so you remain in control
* Security policies are enforced with trusted execution environment based checks
* Important actions can require additional approval such as two factor authentication
* Axal automates complex steps like batching and gas handling while keeping you in control

## Good practices for your wallet

* Keep your private key and recovery information safe and offline when possible
* Enable two factor authentication for sensitive actions
* Review transaction details before approving
* Start with small amounts when using a new network or application
