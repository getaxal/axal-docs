This page explains how users move money into Axal and see it allocated to yield with a simple and safe experience.

## Overview

Axal partners with MoonPay to provide virtual bank accounts that accept supported stablecoins and route funds directly into Axal Yield. This creates an easy path from deposit to on chain allocation with full user control and clear visibility.

## What you can expect

* Simple deposits through MoonPay virtual accounts
* Automatic routing into Axal Yield after funds arrive
* Real time rebalancing across a curated set of strategies
* End to end transparency over activity and balances

## How deposits work step by step

1. Create or sign in to your Axal account and complete any required verification.
2. Open the Deposit flow and choose Bank or Crypto depending on your source.
3. If you use a MoonPay virtual account, send supported stablecoins such as USDC or USDT to the provided details. If you use a wallet, send the asset to your Axal address on the selected network.
4. Axal detects the incoming transfer. You will see a pending status until confirmations complete.
5. After confirmation, the Axal yield engine allocates funds across strategies that are currently generating about 6 to 10 percent APY.
6. You can view allocations, performance, and history on the Portfolio page at any time.

## Why MoonPay virtual accounts matter

MoonPay virtual accounts make crypto native deposits feel like familiar bank transfers. They provide real time reconciliation, automatic routing into Axal Yield, and clear records so you always know where funds are and what they are earning.

## Security and control

* Non custodial by design with Privy smart wallets so you control your wallet
* TEE enforced signing policies and batched execution for strong protection
* Continuous monitoring and risk aware allocation to help safeguard funds

## Fees and timing

* Network gas costs are paid by the sender when using a wallet
* Axal does not charge a deposit fee
* Layer two networks often confirm within minutes while mainnet confirmations can take longer

## Example flow

1. You select USDC as the asset and copy the deposit details shown by MoonPay or your Axal address.
2. You send one thousand USDC from your exchange or wallet.
3. Axal shows the transfer as pending. After confirmations, your balance updates.
4. The yield engine allocates your funds to a diversified lending strategy that is targeting stable performance.
5. You monitor returns from the Portfolio view and can withdraw at any time.
