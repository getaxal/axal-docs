## Privacy Policy

**Effective: January 31, 2025**

This Privacy Policy ("Policy") describes how Lockbox Technologies, Inc. ("Axal," "we," "our," "us") collects, uses, and discloses certain personal information obtained through our websites ("Sites"), which is located at https://www.ax.al, https://www.getaxal.com, https://www.gekkoterminal.ai, https://www.useaxal.com, and https://www.axal.app, as well as information that we process as part of offering you our services, including Axal, which is located at https://www.getaxal.com (collectively with the Site, the "Services"). By using our Services, you are agreeing to the terms of this Policy. This Policy is incorporated into, is part of, and is governed by the Axal Terms and Conditions (the "Terms & Conditions") at https://getaxal.com/tos.

## What Information We Collect and Maintain About You

We collect personal and other information from you directly when you provide it to us through the Services. We also automatically collect certain information about you and your computer, smartphone, or other device when you use, access, or interact with our Services.

**Personal information collected from accountholders.** If you create an account or sign-in with a third-party account in relation to our Services, we will collect information from you related to maintaining your account. This may include your name, email address, digital wallet, and information and preferences related to your portfolio. We may also collect information about you from third parties, such as publicly available sources and data providers, in relation providing you our Services.

**Other personal information collected through the Site.** You can visit the Site without submitting any information that we can use to identify you personally. However, to use certain features on the Site, such as the "Axal Interest Form" feature, you will be required to provide personal information. Such information could include, for example, your name, email address, and company.

**Web log data.** When you use the Services, we automatically receive and record certain information from your computer (or other device) and your browser. This may include such data as your IP address and domain name, the pages you visit on the Services sites, the date and time of your visit, the files that you download, the URLs from the websites you visit before and after using the Services, your software and hardware attributes (including device IDs), your general geographic location (e.g., your city, state, or metropolitan region), and certain cookie information (see below). To obtain such information, we may use web logs or applications that recognize your computer and gather information about its online activity.

**Cookies.** We use cookies on Services webpages. Cookies are small files that are stored on your computer by your web browser. A cookie allows the Services to recognize whether you have visited before and may store user preferences and other information. For example, cookies can be used to collect or store information about your use of the Services during your current session and over time (including the pages you view and the files you download), your computer's operating system and browser type, your Internet service provider, your domain name and IP address, your general geographic location, the website that you visited before visiting the Services webpages, and the link you used to leave the Services. If you are concerned about having cookies on your computer, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being set, allowing you to decide whether to accept it. You can also delete cookies from your computer. However, if you choose to block or delete cookies, certain features of the Services may not operate correctly.

**Web beacons.** The Services or the emails that you receive from Axal may use an application known as a "web beacon" (also known as a "clear gif" or "web bug"). A web beacon is an electronic file that usually consists of a single-pixel image. It can be embedded in a web page or in an email to transmit information, which could include personal information. For example, it can allow an email sender to determine whether a user has opened a particular email.

**Third-party online tracking and behavioral advertising.** We may partner with certain third parties to collect, analyze, and use the personal and other information described in this section. For example, we may allow third parties to set cookies or use web beacons on the Site or in email communications from us. This information may be used for a variety of purposes, including online interest-based advertising, as discussed below (see "With Whom and Why We Share Your Information").

## How We Use and Process Your Information

We use the information that we collect (described in "What Information We Collect and Maintain About You," above) for a variety of purposes, including to:

- Provide you with our Services, fulfill the terms of any agreement you have with us, or otherwise complete a transaction that you initiate;
- Respond to your questions or requests concerning the Services;
- Deliver confirmations, account information, notifications, and similar operational communications;
- Send you information about our Services and other topics that are likely to be of interest to you, including newsletters, security alerts, updates, or other communications, including promotional emails;

- Manage our business.

We may link information gathered through the Services with information that we collect in other contexts. But in that event, we will handle the combined information in a manner consistent with this Policy.

## With Whom and Why We Share Your Information

We may share any of the information described in "What Information We Collect and Maintain About You," above, with other parties for a variety of purposes, as described below.

**Third-party service providers.** Axal uses third-party service providers that perform services on our behalf, including web-hosting companies, mailing vendors, crypto wallet, payment and billing services, marketing, and analytics providers. These service providers may collect and/or use your information, including information that identifies you personally, to assist us in achieving the purposes discussed above.

We may share your information with other third parties when necessary to fulfill your requests for services; to complete a transaction that you initiate; to meet the terms of any agreement that you have with us or our partners; or to manage our business.

These third parties may use web logs or web beacons, and they may set and access cookies on your computer or other device. In particular, the Services use Google Analytics to help collect and analyze certain information for the purposes discussed above. You may opt out of the use of cookies by Google Analytics here.

**Do Not Track signals:** Our Site does not currently respond to "do not track" browser headers.

**Blockchain.** Since the blockchain is a public record, the transaction records associated with any transactions you make using the Services will be publicly available on the blockchain.

**Legal purposes.** We may use or share your information with third parties when we believe, in our sole discretion, that doing so is necessary:

- To comply with applicable law or a court order, subpoena, or other legal process;

- To establish, protect, or exercise our legal rights or defend against legal claims; or
- To facilitate the financing, securitization, insuring, sale, assignment, bankruptcy, or other disposal of all or part of our business or assets.

**Aggregated and de-identified information.** Sometimes we aggregate or de-identify information so that it can no longer identify you, as defined under applicable laws. We can use and disclose this aggregated or de-identified information for any purpose, unless an applicable law says otherwise. We will maintain and use such information in deidentified form and not attempt to reidentify the information, except where reidentification is allowed by law for particular purposes.
