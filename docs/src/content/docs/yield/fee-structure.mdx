## Fee Overview

We maintain a simple and transparent, tiered fee structure designed to align our incentives with your success and the risk level of your chosen strategy:

<div className="fee-table">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Action</th>
        <th>Fee</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>Performance (Conservative)</td>
        <td>15% of yield</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Performance (Moderate)</td>
        <td>20% of yield</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Performance (Aggressive)</td>
        <td>25% of yield</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Withdrawal (if done within 72h of deposit)</td>
        <td>0.1%</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Flashâ€‘loan unwind in emergency deleverage</td>
        <td>Gas + 5 bps</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## Fee Principles

### Performance Fee

- Tiered by strategy: Conservative (15%), Moderate (20%), Aggressive (25%)
- Only charged on positive yield (no yield = no fee)
- Calculated and collected at the end of each epoch
- Applied after all gas and operational costs are accounted for

### Early Withdrawal Fee

- Designed to discourage liquidity sniping
- Waived for withdrawals made after 72 hours from deposit
- Directly added to the pool to benefit remaining depositors

### Emergency Deleverage Fee

- Covers the cost of flash-loans needed during emergency unwinding
- Only applied when automatic deleveraging is triggered by market conditions
- Represents the actual cost of the operation plus a minimal service fee
