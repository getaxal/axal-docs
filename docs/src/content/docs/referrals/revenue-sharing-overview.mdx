# Revenue Sharing Overview

## How It Works

When you join Axal, you can generate a unique referral link. Share this link with others, and when someone signs up using your link and generates profits through our platform, you'll earn a percentage of the fee collected on their profits.

When they share a unique referral link, you earn a smaller percentage of the performance fee on those profits as well. The higher the deposits and the greater the referrals, the greater the returns.

**Example:**

## When Funds Are Deposited to Your Account

Referral rewards are calculated and deposited to your Axal account on a monthly basis. The performance fees from your referrals' profits are aggregated on a rolling, 30-day basis. Your share (based on the applicable tier) is credited to your account every 30 days from the date of the original sign-up.
