## Autopilot Portfolio

Axal’s flagship product, Autopilot, is your personal trading agent that executes complex, multi-step cryptocurrency trading strategies automatically. Users can set up parameters to automate rebalancing, yield harvest, create a novel index of tokens they want to invest in, and more.

For example, a user could create an index of memecoins (including tokens across different chains) and set up a parameter that says “the second it dips below 80% of the deposited amount, the agent (solver) sells everything and moves it to my centralized wallet.”
