How we choose strategies

Not all pools are created equal. Before any pool qualifies for allocation, we look at a core set of factors that are designed to tilt toward quality and resilience.

## Smart pool selection

* Risk: How safe is the pool and how are risks mitigated
* Capital size: Is there enough liquidity to support allocations without bottlenecks
* Collateral type: What assets back the pool and how stable are they
* Reputation: Has the protocol proven reliable and secure over time

Only pools that check these boxes make the cut.

## Strategy construction

We combine vetted pools into diversified strategy sets so no single position dominates your outcome. As market conditions evolve, new pools can be added and outdated ones retired, while overall risk remains balanced.

## Ongoing monitoring

* Track realized and projected yield
* Watch liquidity depth and utilization
* Monitor risk signals and protocol updates
* Attribute returns so you understand where yield is coming from
