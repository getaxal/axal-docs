## Disclosures

### Risk Disclosures
##### General Risk Disclosure Statement for Axal
**Last Updated: 8 May 2025**

### Overview
This Risk Disclosure Statement aims to inform users ("Users") of the potential risks involved with interacting with Axal ("Platform"), an automated yield-generation product within the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. By using Axal, Users acknowledge and accept the risks described herein. This document does not capture all possible risks. The Risk Overview Document attempts to provide an overview of more granular risks. Users should consult with financial, legal, and technical advisors before participating.

### 1. General Platform Risks
#### 1.1. DeFi and Blockchain Risks
Axal operates on multiple public blockchains and integrates with third-party DeFi protocols. Blockchain technology remains experimental and may involve risks such as consensus failures, network congestion, or transaction irreversibility. Users must understand that DeFi platforms differ fundamentally from traditional financial services.
#### 1.2. "As-Is" Basis
Axal is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis without warranties of any kind. Axal makes no representations regarding performance, uptime, or security and disclaims liability for interruptions or losses.

### 2. Financial and Market Risks
#### 2.1. Market Volatility
Crypto markets are highly volatile. Sudden and significant changes in token prices may impact the performance of yield strategies, including losses on deposited collateral.
#### 2.2. Liquidation Risk
Strategies that utilize leverage or lending are exposed to collateral shortfall risk. If the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio breaches predefined thresholds, assets may be liquidated automatically and without notice.
#### 2.3. Liquidity Risk
Low liquidity in integrated protocols or assets may result in slippage, failed withdrawals, or difficulty unwinding positions during turbulent markets.
#### 2.4. Stablecoin De-Peg Risk
Even over-collateralized stablecoins may lose their peg during high-stress events ("bank runs"), potentially causing losses or liquidity bottlenecks. Axal sets hard caps and deploys peg-watchers to halt risky exposure.

### 3. Technology and Security Risks
#### 3.1. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities
Axal integrates with third-party protocols such as Aave, Kamino, Morpho, and others. Despite code audits and reviews, smart contracts are subject to bugs, exploits, or unintended economic behaviors. Interactions with these contracts are inherently risky.
#### 3.2. Oracle and Data Risks
Incorrect or delayed pricing data from on-chain oracles (e.g., Chainlink, Pyth) can result in erroneous liquidations or rebalances. Axal employs multiple oracle sources and medianised price feeds to mitigate this.
#### 3.3. Automation and Rebalancing Risks
Downtime in rebalancing bots may degrade performance. Axal utilizes redundant keeper infrastructure and MEV-resistant transaction routing to reduce this risk.
#### 3.4. Cybersecurity Threats
Although Axal does not custody user funds, relayers and frontends could be targeted by phishing, denial-of-service attacks, or exploits. Users should follow best practices for wallet security and avoid signing unknown messages.

### 4. Operational and Third-Party Risks
#### 4.1. Third-Party Dependencies
Strategies rely on external services, including bridges, routers, and protocol adapters. Failures or exploits in these components can cascade and affect strategy performance. Axal deploys circuit breakers to pause strategies if adapters misbehave beyond a threshold.
#### 4.2. Custody and Counterparty Risk
Axal is non-custodial. All wallets are user-controlled via Privy. Session keys are limited in time/scope, and no relayer or admin can sign on behalf of a user. 
#### 4.3. Platform Downtime
Axal may undergo maintenance or experience technical outages. Strategies are designed to act autonomously on-chain without requiring constant frontend access, but extreme conditions could delay interactions.

### 5. Legal and Regulatory Risks
#### 5.1. Jurisdictional Restrictions
Access may be restricted in jurisdictions where DeFi is prohibited or heavily regulated â€“ such as nations on the OFAC sanctions list. Users are responsible for complying with local laws before using the Platform. Axal employs geofencing where required.
#### 5.2. Regulatory Changes
Future legal developments could limit functionality, tax treatment, or platform accessibility. Axal monitors regulatory developments but cannot guarantee immunity from future legal shifts.
#### 5.3. Tax Responsibilities
Users are solely responsible for assessing and paying any taxes related to their use of Axal. The Platform does not provide tax advice and urges consultation with qualified professionals.

### 6. User Responsibilities
#### 6.1. Due Diligence
Users are expected to understand the mechanics and risks of DeFi, including yield strategy logic, collateral dynamics, and smart contract execution. Axal provides documentation, but usage implies full personal responsibility.
#### 6.2. No Financial Advice
All material published by Axal is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment, legal, or financial advice. Users are encouraged to make decisions independently and consult advisors.
#### 6.3. Private Key Management
Users are solely responsible for wallet access and key custody. Axal cannot recover lost keys or intervene in compromised accounts.

### 7. Platform Modifications and Strategy Risks
#### 7.1. Strategy Composition Risks
Each yield strategy bundles actions across protocols, sometimes involving leverage or synthetic assets. Aggressive tiers carry higher complexity and more potential downside from liquidation, market, or operational risks.
#### 7.2. Updates and Governance
The platform may update strategy logic, adapters, or strategy parameters at any time. Axal will signal major changes via the frontend or Discord, but continued usage implies consent to these changes.
#### 7.3. Strategy-Specific Risks
Strategies are categorized as Conservative, Balanced, or Aggressive to reflect different risk exposures. Users must understand the risk tier before allocating funds. Axal disclaims responsibility for mismatched expectations.

### 8. Acknowledgement of Risk and Waiver of Liability
By using Axal, Users acknowledge and accept all associated risks and understand that Axal, its contributors, and affiliated entities are not liable for any financial, legal, or technical losses incurred. Users waive any claims against the Platform in connection with their activity.

Where legally required, we will provide additional notification, such as through email or other means we consider reasonably likely to reach you.

**7. INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER USERS.** You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Registered Users and any other parties with whom you interact; provided, however, that Axal reserves the right, but has no obligation, to intercede in such disputes. You agree that Axal will not be liable for any liability incurred as the result of such interactions.

Axal is not liable to you in connection with Axal's or any third party's use of the Services to view such Connected Content that you have made publicly available.

You agree that the provisions in this section will survive any termination of the Agreement and/or your access to the Services.

**9. THIRD-PARTY SERVICES.** The Services may contain or in some cases, integrate with our Services, certain Third-Party Services. When you click on a link to or access or use a Third-Party Service, we will not warn you that you have left the Services and are subject to the terms and conditions (including privacy policies) of another website or destination. Such Third-Party Services are not under the control of Axal. Axal is not responsible for any Third-Party Services. Axal provides these Third-Party Services only as a convenience and does not review, approve, monitor, endorse, warrant, or make any representation with respect to Third-Party Services, or any product or service provided in connection therewith. You use all links in Third-Party Services at your own risk. When you leave our Services, this Agreement and our policies no longer govern. You should review applicable terms and policies, including privacy and data gathering practices, of any Third-Party Services, and make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any transaction with any third party.

**10. REFERRAL PROGRAM.** The Referral Program offers Referrers the opportunity to receive certain Incentives for referring other friends to register an account on the Service, if a friend uses the Referrer's Referral Link. This Section, in addition to the foregoing terms in the Agreement and any Additional Referral Terms, shall govern the Referral Program.

Unless otherwise stated in Additional Referral Terms, subject to Referrer's ongoing compliance with the Agreement, each Referrer shall be entitled to receive fifty percent (50%) of Platform Fees paid by any Friend that uses such Referrer's Referral Link to sign up for an account on the Services for six (6) months following the date of sign-up.

Unless otherwise stated in Additional Referral Terms, Incentives shall be paid to Referrer's Wallet within (30) days of the date on which the applicable Platform Fees are paid.

Each Referrer is solely responsible for any taxes payable on Incentives received by such Referrer, and Referrer agrees to indemnify Axal against any claims arising from or related to any tax liabilities whether or not paid.

Referral Links are personal and should only be shared with people you personally know, for non-commercial and personal use only. Sharing Referral Links beyond your close network of personal connections is strictly forbidden. Referral Links must not be published or distributed, including but not limited to commercial websites (e.g., coupon platforms, Twitter, or Reddit) or blogs. You are not allowed to engage in "spamming" when sharing Referral Links. This includes bulk emailing, texting, or messaging individuals you do not know, or using automated tools or bots on any platform to disseminate your Referral Link. Additionally, you may not pay to advertise a Referral Link or provide compensation or incentives to anyone to whom you direct a Referral Link or to any third party to gain an Incentive.

When sharing a Referral Link, you are required to inform the recipient ("Friend") that you will receive an Incentive (and describe the nature of the Incentive) if they register for an account using your Referral Link. You must also obtain the Friend's explicit consent before sharing the Referral Link with them. All sharing activities must comply with applicable laws, rules, and regulations. Any statements you make about Axal or its products and services must: (a) be truthful and based on publicly available information, and (b) include a clear, conspicuous disclaimer that such statements reflect only your personal opinion and not those of Axal. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Axal and its affiliates from any claims, damages, costs, expenses, or liabilities (including reasonable legal fees) arising from or related to your breach or alleged breach of this Section.

By allowing you to participate in the Referral Program, Axal does not authorize you to make statements on its behalf, including regarding its products, services, or the Referral Program. Any such statements are expressly disapproved by Axal.

Axal reserves the right to suspend or terminate the Referral Program or your participation in it at any time, for any reason. For example, Axal may review and investigate referral activities and suspend access to the Services, or revoke or void earned Incentives at its sole discretion if it identifies conduct it considers abusive, fraudulent, or in violation of this Agreement or additional Referral Terms. Axal also reserves the right to deactivate Referral Links or modify Incentives associated with any Referral Link or offer at any time, for any reason. Additionally, Axal may retroactively revoke or void any Incentive if, in its sole judgment, it determines that the Incentive was earned: 1) in violation of this Agreement, such as failing to meet eligibility requirements, or distributing Referral Links through unauthorized channels or in violation of any applicable law, rule, or regulation; or 2) in connection with content Axal deems offensive or inappropriate. Examples of such content include, but are not limited to, pornography, obscene or indecent language, material promoting hate or violence, or content that damages Axal's goodwill, reputation, or brand image, or endorses discrimination in any form.

A referred individual may only use one Referral Link. If a referred individual receives multiple Referral Links, only the person associated with the Referral Link actually used during the account registration will be eligible to receive the Incentive.

**11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION.** You agree that any dispute, claim, or request for relief relating to your access or use of the Services, or any aspect of your relationship with Axal, will be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court, except that: 1) you may bring claims or seek relief in small claims court if your claims qualify; and 2) you or Axal may seek equitable relief in court for issues involving infringement or misuse of intellectual property rights (such as trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, domain names, or trade dress). This Arbitration Agreement applies to all disputes, claims, and requests for relief, including those arising before the effective date of this Agreement or any prior version.

The Federal Arbitration Act governs this Arbitration Agreement's interpretation and enforcement. To initiate arbitration, you must send a written request detailing your dispute, claim, or request for relief to the address specified in Section 15.8. The arbitration will be conducted by JAMS, an established alternative dispute resolution provider. Claims or disputes involving amounts under $250,000 (excluding attorneys' fees and interest) will follow JAMS's Streamlined Arbitration Rules, available at www.jamsadr.com/rules-streamlined-arbitration/.

If JAMS is unavailable, an alternative arbitral forum will be selected. If the arbitrator determines that you cannot afford the filing, administrative, or hearing fees charged by JAMS, and JAMS denies a fee waiver, Axal will cover these costs. Axal will also reimburse such fees for disputes totaling less than $10,000, unless deemed frivolous by the arbitrator. Arbitration may occur by phone, based on written submissions, or in person at a mutually agreed location or your county of residence. The arbitrator's decision may be enforced in any court with proper jurisdiction.

The arbitrator has exclusive authority to: 1) determine the scope and enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement; and 2) resolve any disputes regarding its interpretation, applicability, or formation, including claims that any part of it is void or unenforceable.

The arbitrator will determine the rights and liabilities of both you and Axal on an individual basis and cannot consolidate claims or join cases involving others. They can issue dispositive rulings, award monetary or non-monetary remedies, and must provide a written explanation of their decision. The arbitrator's decision is final and binding.

YOU AND AXAL WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL OR STATUTORY RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL BY JUDGE OR JURY. Arbitration under this Agreement will replace traditional court processes. While the arbitrator can award damages and relief as a court would, the absence of a judge or jury limits court review of the arbitration outcome. All disputes, claims, or requests for relief must be arbitrated individually, not as part of a class or collective action. No group claims can be consolidated. If applicable law prohibits enforcement of this provision for a specific claim, that claim may proceed in state or federal court in Delaware, while all others remain subject to arbitration.

You may opt out of this Arbitration Agreement within 30 days of becoming subject to it by sending written notice to the address in Section 15.8. Your notice must include your name, address, account details (e.g., Wallet address or Third-Party Account username), and a clear statement of your decision to opt out. Opting out does not affect other parts of this Agreement or any other arbitration agreements you have with Axal.

If any part of this Arbitration Agreement is found invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will continue in full effect, except as outlined in Section 13.5 regarding class or collective relief. This Arbitration Agreement will survive the termination of your relationship with Axal. If Axal makes material changes to this Arbitration Agreement, you may reject those changes within 30 days of their effective date by sending written notice to the address in Section 15.8.

**12. ASSUMPTION OF RISK IN BLOCKCHAIN TRANSACTIONS.** Transactions involving Digital Assets require confirmation on their supporting blockchain, a process entirely beyond Axal's control. Axal does not guarantee that transactions initiated or received through its Services will be validated, nor can it modify or cancel any transaction once submitted. You acknowledge full responsibility for all activity in your Wallet, including any losses, whether from authorized or unauthorized access. Axal provides no warranties regarding blockchain activity or the success of transactions and is not liable for delays, errors, or disruptions related to blockchain performance.

By using blockchain technology, you affirm that you possess the technical and professional expertise to evaluate the operation and security of your Wallet and the associated risks of blockchain-based transactions. You agree to independently assess the risks tied to specific Digital Assets, including their volatility, and to comply with applicable legal and tax obligations. Axal is not responsible for determining or reporting taxes, nor does it store, send, or receive Digital Assets. Transactions occur solely on the blockchain and are subject to its conditions, delays, or failures.

Axal does not guarantee the security or governance of any blockchain, nor can it prevent risks like hacks, counterfeit assets, or bugs in smart contracts. The Services rely on third-party Wallets (e.g., MetaMask, Ledger, Privy) and Ecosystem Partners, whose functionality Axal does not warrant. Furthermore, evolving regulations and unforeseen changes to blockchain protocols may adversely impact the utility, value, or transferability of Digital Assets. You accept these risks as inherent to blockchain technology and acknowledge that Axal is not liable for any losses or adverse outcomes.

Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion. If any part of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, it will not affect the validity of the balance of this Agreement, which shall remain valid and enforceable according to its terms.
