## About the Product

Axal Yield is a single‑deposit, multi‑strategy executor that allocates capital across blue‑chip money markets, structured liquidity products, and automated leverage loops. Our goal is simple: give depositors risk‑adjusted yield while giving investors full transparency into how that yield is created.

Why We Built It
- Fragmented opportunities:  Good yields exist on every chain, but capital efficiency plummets when users have to chase them manually.
- Operational drag: Rebalancing, gas, slippage, and bad timing erode net returns.
- Uneven risk disclosure: Many vaults hide methodology, making it impossible to underwrite risk.

Axal Yield solves all three with autonomous rebalancing, public on‑chain reporting, and a tiered strategy stack so users can choose their own risk/reward.
