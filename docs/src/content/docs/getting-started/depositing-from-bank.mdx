## ACH Funding via Moonpay

You can also fund your Axal account using ACH (Automated Clearing House) transfers through Moonpay's virtual account system. This provides an additional convenient way to deposit funds from your bank account.

### How ACH Works

ACH transfers allow you to electronically move money between bank accounts. When you use Moonpay's virtual account:

1. **Virtual Account Setup**: Moonpay creates a temporary virtual account for your deposit
2. **Bank Transfer**: You transfer funds from your bank to this virtual account
3. **Automatic Processing**: Once received, funds are automatically credited to your Axal account
4. **Real-time Updates**: Your Axal balance updates immediately upon successful transfer

### Benefits of ACH

- **Lower Fees**: ACH transfers typically have lower fees than wire transfers
- **Wider Bank Support**: Works with virtually all US banks and credit unions
- **Convenient**: No need to manually enter account details each time
- **Secure**: Bank-level security protocols protect your transfers

### Processing Times

- **Standard ACH**: 1-3 business days
- **Same-day ACH**: Available for qualifying transfers (additional fees may apply)

## Security

All bank connections use bank-level encryption and security protocols.
