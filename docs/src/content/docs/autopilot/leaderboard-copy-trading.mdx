## Leaderboard

The Axal Leaderboard showcases top-performing traders and their strategies, allowing you to discover successful investment approaches and the traders behind them.

- **Strategy Insights**: Understand trading methodologies and asset allocations
- **Real-time Updates**: Leaderboard rankings update regularly to reflect current market performance

## Copy Trading

Copy trading enables you to automatically replicate the strategies of top-performing traders with minimal effort.

### How It Works

1. Browse the leaderboard to find traders whose strategies align with your goals
2. Select a trader to follow and allocate your desired amount of capital
3. Your portfolio will automatically mirror their trades proportionally to your allocation
4. Monitor performance and adjust your allocations as needed

### Benefits

- **Leverage Expertise**: Gain from experienced traders' market knowledge
- **Portfolio Diversification**: Follow multiple traders to spread risk
- **Learning Opportunity**: Observe successful strategies while maintaining full control of your funds
- **Time Efficiency**: Automate your trading while still benefiting from expert decision-making
