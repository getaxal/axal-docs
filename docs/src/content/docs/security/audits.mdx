Axal has partnered with Sherlock, a web3 auditing and security firm, to help ensure the safety of users funds through rigorous and repeatable reviews. We conducted a white box audit of our Trusted Execution Environment based signer and a black box audit of our production servers. You can read more about the distinction between white box and black box methodologies [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/software-testing/differences-between-black-box-testing-vs-white-box-testing/).

## How a web3 audit works at Axal

Web3 systems span on chain code, off chain services, and the seams between them. Our audits therefore combine multiple lenses into a single narrative assessment:

* Design review and threat modeling to map assets, trust boundaries, and failure modes across smart contracts, TEEs, services, and wallets.
* Deep source review of critical components with static analysis, invariant and property checks, and targeted fuzzing where applicable.
* Environment hardening review, including identity and access management, build pipelines, artifact signing, logging, and secrets handling.
* Behavioral testing of the full system using pre production configurations and on chain simulations to exercise edge cases, pause paths, and kill switches.
* Remediation, retesting, and documentation to verify issues are fixed and controls are durable.

## Audit results

Axalâ€™s audit report can be found [here](/pdfs/Sherlock%20Audit%20-%20Axal.pdf). All identified issues have been addressed. We have open sourced our signer and welcome community review and bug reports.

## Continuous assurance

Security does not end with a single audit. We pair audits with hardening work, continuous monitoring, and a live bug bounty so researchers can report emergent issues quickly.
