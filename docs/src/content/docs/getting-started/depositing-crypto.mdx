This guide walks you through depositing crypto into Axal based on the product flow shown in the demo. You will create or sign in to your account, your smart wallet will be created for you, then you will fund it by either connecting your own external wallet like MetaMask or Phantom wallet, or scanning the wallet QR code to transfer in USDC on the Base Network.

## What you need

- An Axal account
- USDC on the Base network
- A wallet or exchange that can send USDC on Base

## Create your account and wallet

1. Open the app and select Launch.
2. Enter your email or continue with Google.
3. Axal creates a special wallet for you. You will see your wallet address on screen.
4. Optionally enable two factor authentication. When enabled, sensitive actions such as making withdrawals or moving funds out require a code from your authenticator app.

## Deposit with crypto wallet

Depositing with crypto has three methods you can choose from:

1. Copy the wallet address and initiate the transaction in your external wallet interface
2. Connect to an external wallet and transfer the transaction on the Axal site
3. Scan the wallet QR code to initiate the transaction

1. From the Deposit view, choose either connect to an external wallet or expand the wallet QR code. You can also copy your Axal wallet address and directly transfer funds from your external wallet.

2. When you connect an external wallet, select the amount you'd like to deposit and click "Confirm" and then sign the transaction on your wallet's interface.

3. Please ensure that you're transferring USDC on the base network. The minimum requirement is $35. Your transaction will be confirmed once the wallet balance on the left changes.

## Troubleshooting

- Deposit not showing: verify the transaction hash on the correct network explorer and allow for confirmations.

- Sent on the wrong network: contact support (email hello@getaxal.com) with the transaction hash so the team can advise on recovery options.
- Stuck transaction: try resubmitting with a higher gas setting if your wallet supports it.
