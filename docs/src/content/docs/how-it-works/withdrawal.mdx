3. Follow the prompts to export your recovery phrase and import it in your wallet provider.

## Secrets You'll Need

- **Seed phrase (Secret Recovery Phrase) or Private key**: Store securely and never share
- **MFA code (if enabled)**: Axal will prompt for multi‑factor authentication during withdrawal

## Transfer Out

After exporting your wallet, initiate the on‑chain transfer from your self‑custody wallet:

- Select the correct network (e.g., Base, Ethereum, Solana)
- Paste the destination address and confirm fees
- Submit the transaction and wait for confirmations

## Notes & Best Practices

- Verify addresses and networks before sending
- Keep a small amount of native gas token for network fees
- Never share or store your seed phrase/private key in plaintext
- If MFA is enabled, keep your authenticator accessible during the process
