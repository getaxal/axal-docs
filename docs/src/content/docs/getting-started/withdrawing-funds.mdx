## One‑Click Withdrawal (Close Positions)
Use the one‑click withdrawal to exit all active positions. Axal will:
1. **Close positions** across supported protocols
2. **Settle rewards/fees** into your account
3. **Convert holdings** to **Uninvested Cash** in your dashboard

Once completed, your balance is idle and ready to transfer.

## Export Your Wallet to a Third‑Party
To move funds off Axal, export your Privy smart wallet to a self‑custody wallet such as **MetaMask** (EVM) or **Phantom** (Solana):
1. Open Wallet Settings → Export
2. Choose the target wallet (MetaMask, Phantom, etc.)
3. Follow the prompts to import using your credentials

### Secrets You’ll Need
- **Seed phrase (Secret Recovery Phrase)** or **Private key**: Store securely and never share
- **MFA code** (if enabled): Axal will prompt for multi‑factor authentication during export/withdrawal

## Transfer Out
After exporting, initiate the on‑chain transfer from your self‑custody wallet:
- Select the correct network (e.g., Base, Ethereum, Solana)
- Paste the destination address and confirm fees
- Submit the transaction and wait for confirmations

## Notes & Best Practices
- Verify addresses and networks before sending
- Keep a small amount of native gas token for network fees
- Never share or store your seed phrase/private key in plaintext
- If MFA is enabled, keep your authenticator accessible during the process
