# Verified Signing

Understanding Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) technology for secure transactions.

## What is TEE?

Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is a secure area within a processor that ensures code and data are protected from unauthorized access.

## How Verified Signing Works

1. **Secure Environment**: Transactions are processed in isolated TEE
2. **Key Protection**: Private keys never leave the secure environment
3. **Verification**: All transactions are cryptographically verified
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete transaction history maintained

## Security Benefits

- **Hardware Isolation**: Physical separation from main system
- **Tamper Resistance**: Protected against software attacks
- **Key Security**: Private keys never exposed
- **Verification**: All operations are cryptographically verified

## Use Cases

- **High-Value Transactions**: Large transfers require TEE verification
- **Multi-Sig Operations**: Enhanced security for multi-signature wallets
- **Institutional Accounts**: Enterprise-grade security requirements
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meet strict security standards

## Technical Implementation

- **Intel SGX**: Secure enclave technology
- **ARM TrustZone**: Mobile device security
- **Custom Hardware**: Specialized security modules
- **Audit Logs**: Complete transaction verification
