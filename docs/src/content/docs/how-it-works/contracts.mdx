How our contracts keep allocations transparent

All allocations are managed through transparent, audited smart contracts. There are no middlemen and no hidden moves, only code that executes the documented strategy logic. This section summarizes the contract roles and where they sit in the system.

## What are smart contracts

Smart contracts are programs on chain that automatically enforce rules when predefined conditions are met. They provide a verifiable way to route deposits, manage allocations, and execute rebalances.

## Contracts and vaults

All allocations sit on Base and are wired to explicit contract addresses. Below we outline the key vault contracts, the deposit token, and the external protocol contracts our system interacts with. This list reflects the live configuration and is kept current as components evolve.
