## Protocol Selection

Our methodology for selecting protocols follows a rigorous evaluation process based on four key criteria:

<div className="criteria-table">
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Criteria</th>
        <th>Description</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td className="criteria safety">Safety Score</td>
        <td>Audit history, TVL persistence, oracle robustness.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td className="criteria yield">Yield Sustainability</td>
        <td>Source of yield (fees vs. emissions), incentive decay curves.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td className="criteria diversification">Diversification Value</td>
        <td>Correlation to existing asset exposure.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td className="criteria operational">Operational Fit</td>
        <td>Availability of programmatic rebalancing hooks and granular APIs.</td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
</div>

## Position Management

We employ sophisticated position management techniques to optimize yield while protecting your capital:

### Smart Rebalancer

An on‑chain agent that tilts allocations toward the best Sharpe‑adjusted opportunities every epoch.

### Auto‑Deleverage 

If LTV on any leveraged leg drifts > 70%, collateral is partially unwound using flash-loans before liquidation triggers.

### Cross‑Platform Hedging

Surplus fees from Conservative vaults can be routed to backstop Aggressive vault liquidations during tail events.

## Security & Audits

All integration points with third-party protocols undergo rigorous security reviews before deployment. Our security measures include:

- Independent security audits for all vaults
- Multi-signature controls on key operations
- Continuous monitoring of integrated protocols
- Regular stress testing of liquidation scenarios

## Transparency & Reporting

We prioritize complete transparency in all our operations:

- Real‑time strategy weights and vault addresses are published on the Transparency Hub.
- APY is reported net of fees and follows the same time‑weighted method disclosed in our docs.
- Historical performance CSVs can be downloaded for independent analysis.
