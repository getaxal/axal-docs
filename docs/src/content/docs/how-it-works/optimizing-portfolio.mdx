How we optimize your money

When you put money into Axal, we do not drop it all into one place and hope for the best. We carefully choose where it goes and how it is spread out, with a clear goal of seeking strong returns while keeping risks in check.

## Diversification by design

We do not put all your eggs in one basket. Funds are spread across a mix of pools and protocols. This diversification helps reduce exposure to any single risk. If one pool underperforms, others help balance it out. A rebalancer that continuously tunes these weights is in progress and coming soon.

## How it works day to day

* Your deposit appears and is routed to eligible strategies.
* Allocations are diversified across pools that pass our checks.
* Performance and risk are monitored so we can react to changing conditions.
* As the rebalancer rolls out, weights will be adjusted more frequently and with less drift.

## What you see

* Clear portfolio view of where funds are allocated
* Transparent notes on changes and rationale
* Simple controls to add or withdraw without managing transactions yourself

## Best practices for users

* Review your portfolio regularly
* Add funds on a schedule that fits your plan
* Keep a cash buffer outside of invested funds for short term needs
* Stay focused on long term goals, not short term noise
