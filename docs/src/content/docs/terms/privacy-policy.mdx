## Privacy Policy
**Last updated: November 25th, 2024**

This Privacy Policy describes the privacy practices of Lockbox Technologies, Inc. ("Axal," "we," "us," or "our") and how we handle personal information that we collect through our digital properties that link to this Privacy Policy, including our website, as well as through social media, our marketing activities, webinars, conferences, and other activities described in this Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Service").

**Personal information we collect**

*Information you provide to us.* Personal information you may provide to us through the Service or otherwise includes:

- Communications that we exchange with you, including when you contact us with questions or feedback, post to our communication boards, through social media (including Discord and X), or otherwise. 
- Other data not specifically listed here, which we will use as described in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise disclosed at the time of collection.

*Third-party sources.* We may receive personal information about you from third-party sources. For example, we may obtain your personal information from third parties such as publicly available sources and data providers.

*Automatic data collection.* Our service providers and business partners may automatically log information about you, your computer or mobile device, and your interaction over time with the Service, our communications, and other online services, such as:

- Device data, such as your computer's or mobile device's operating system type and version, manufacturer and model, browser type, screen resolution, RAM and disk size, CPU usage, device type (e.g., phone, tablet), IP address, unique identifiers (including identifiers used for advertising purposes), language settings, mobile device carrier, radio/network information (e.g., WiFi, LTE, 3G), and general location information such as city, state, or geographic area.
- Online activity data, such as pages or screens you viewed, how long you spent on a page or screen, the website you visited before browsing to the Service, navigation paths between pages or screens, information about your activity on a page or screen, access times and duration, and whether you opened our marketing emails or clicked links within them.

**How we use your personal information**

We use your personal information for the following purposes or as otherwise described at the time of collection:

*Service delivery*

We use your personal information to:

- Provide, operate, and improve the Service and our business.
- Communicate with you about the Service, including by sending announcements, updates, security alerts, and support and administrative messages.
- Understand your needs and interests, and personalize your experience with the Service and our communications.
- Provide support for the Service and respond to your requests, questions, and feedback.

*Research and development*

We may use your personal information for research and development purposes, including analyzing and improving the Service and our business. As part of these activities, we may create aggregated, de-identified, or other anonymous data from personal information we collect. We anonymize personal information by removing information that makes the data personally identifiable to you.

*Compliance and protection*

We may use your personal information to:

- Comply with applicable laws, lawful requests, and legal processes, such as responding to subpoenas or requests from government authorities.
- Protect our, your, or others' rights, privacy, safety, or property (including by making and defending legal claims).
- Audit our internal processes for compliance with legal and contractual requirements and internal policies.
- Enforce the terms and conditions governing the Service.
- Prevent, identify, investigate, and deter fraudulent, harmful, unauthorized, unethical, or illegal activity, including cyberattacks and identity theft.

**How we share your personal information**

We may share your personal information with the following parties and as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy or at the time of collection:

*Service providers.* Companies and individuals that provide services on our behalf or help us operate the Service or our business (e.g., hosting, information technology, customer support, email delivery, marketing, and website analytics). For example, we may use Google Analytics and Amplitude to collect and process analytics information on our Services.

*Blockchain.* Since the blockchain is a public record, the transaction records associated with any transactions you make using the Service will be publicly available on the blockchain.

*Authorities and others.* Law enforcement, government authorities, and private parties, as we believe in good faith to be necessary or appropriate for compliance and protection purposes described above.

*Business transferees.* Acquirers and other relevant participants in business transactions (or negotiations for such transactions) involving a corporate divestiture, merger, consolidation, acquisition, reorganization, sale, or other disposition of all or any portion of the business or assets of, or equity interests in, Axal (including in connection with bankruptcy or similar proceedings).

**Your choices**

You have the following choices with respect to your personal information:

*Do Not Track.* Some internet browsers may be configured to send "Do Not Track" signals to the online services that you visit. We currently do not respond to "Do Not Track" or similar signals. To find out more about "Do Not Track," please visit www.allaboutdnt.com.

*Declining to provide information.* We aim to collect as little personal information as possible to provide the Service. We will inform you at the time of collection what information is necessary for us to provide the Service. However, we may be unable to provide other services, such as customer support, without personal information.

**Security and international data transfer**

We implement a variety of technical, organizational, and physical measures aimed at safeguarding the personal information we collect. We strive to minimize the amount of personal information collected to deliver the Service effectively. However, all internet and information technologies carry inherent security risks, and we cannot fully guarantee the protection of your personal information.

Our headquarters is in the United States, and we may engage service providers located in other countries. As a result, your personal information may be transferred to the United States or other jurisdictions where privacy laws may offer less protection than those in your state, province, or country.

**Children**

The Service is not intended for children under the age of 13. If we become aware that personal information has been collected through the Service from a child under 13 without the requisite parental or guardian consent, as required by law, we will promptly delete that information.

**California Privacy Rights**

Residents of California have the right to request a notice detailing the categories of personal information we share with third parties for marketing purposes, along with contact details for those third parties. If you are a California resident and wish to receive this notice, please send a written request to us via email at hello@getaxal.com. Be sure to include the statement "Your California Privacy Rights" in your request, along with your name, street address, city, state, and ZIP code. Requests that are improperly labeled, submitted, or incomplete will not be processed.

**Changes to this Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy at any time. If significant changes are made, we will notify you by revising the date of this Privacy Policy and posting it on the Service. Where legally required, we will provide additional notification, such as through email or other means we consider reasonably likely to reach you. Changes to the Privacy Policy take effect when the revised version is posted (or as specified at the time of posting). Your continued use of the Service after any changes are effective constitutes your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
